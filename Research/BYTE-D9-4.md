As part of the final dissemination work for BYTE, the project produced a
Showcase video for the project and the European Commission to use to publicise
the project, the BYTE Big Data Community and the work undertaken. At the close
of the project, the BYTE consortium produced a 3 minute video, using
icon-based animation techniques currently popular in this genre. The video was
produced by KIFU, in collaboration with CNR, TRI and UIBK.

The video outlines the purpose of the BYTE project, describing the context,
the project's main objectives and the reason the project was funded.

The video also highlights the BYTE case studies and the roadmap, points
viewers to where they can find more information, and ends describing how
interested individuals can get involved in the BYTE Big Data Community and the
further activities after the close of the project.
