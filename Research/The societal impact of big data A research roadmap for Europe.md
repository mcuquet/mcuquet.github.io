With its rapid growth and increasing adoption, big data is producing a
substantial impact in society. Its usage is opening both opportunities such as
new business models and economic gains and risks such as privacy violations
and discrimination. Europe is in need of a comprehensive strategy to optimise
the use of data for a societal benefit and increase the innovation and
competitiveness of its productive activities. In this paper, we contribute to
the definition of this strategy with a research roadmap to capture the
economic, social and ethical, legal and political benefits associated with the
use of big data in Europe. The present roadmap considers the positive and
negative externalities associated with big data, maps research and innovation
topics in the areas of data management, processing, analytics, protection,
visualisation, as well as non-technical topics, to the externalities they can
tackle, and provides a time frame to address these topics in order to deliver
social impact, skills development and standardisation. Finally, it also
identifies what sectors will be most benefited by each of the research
efforts. The goal of the roadmap is to guide European research efforts to
develop a socially responsible big data economy, and to allow stakeholders to
identify and meet big data challenges and proceed with a shared understanding
of the societal impact, positive and negative externalities and concrete
problems worth investigating in future programmes.
