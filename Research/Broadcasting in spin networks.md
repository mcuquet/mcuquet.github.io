We present an implementation of \\(N \to M\\) quantum broadcasting of mixed qubits
in the equatorial plane in an unmodulated spin network. The broadcasting
transformation is performed by the time evolution of the network. We focus in
the _XX_ Hamiltonian because its appropriate symmetry in the _XY_ plane and
its easy physical implementation. We study two scenarios with different initial
state of the network: one in a pure state \\(|M/2,m\rangle\\) and the other in the
tensor product of maximally mixed states. We also focus in the \\(3 \to 4\\)
scenario, where in principle perfect phase covariant broadcasting is possible.
