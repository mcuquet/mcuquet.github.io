We present an implementation of _N_ to _M_ quantum broadcasting of mixed
qubits in the equatorial plane in an unmodulated spin network. The
broadcasting transformation is performed by the time evolution of the network.
We focus in the _XX_ Hamiltonian because its appropriate symmetry in the _XY_
plane and its easy physical implementation. We study two scenarios with
different initial state of the network: one in a pure state |M/2,m> and the
other in the tensor product of maximally mixed states. We also focus in the 3
to 4 scenario, where in principle perfect phase covariant broadcasting is
possible.
