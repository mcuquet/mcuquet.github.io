Quantum networks are essential to quantum information distributed
applications, and communicating over them is a key challenge. Complex networks
have rich and intriguing properties, which are as yet unexplored in the
quantum setting. Here, we study the effect of entanglement percolation as a
means to establish long-distance entanglement between arbitrary nodes of
quantum complex networks. We develop a theory to analytically study random
graphs with arbitrary degree distribution and give exact results for some
models. Our findings are in good agreement with numerical simulations and show
that the proposed quantum strategies enhance the percolation threshold
substantially. Simulations also show a clear enhancement in small-world and
other real-world networks.
