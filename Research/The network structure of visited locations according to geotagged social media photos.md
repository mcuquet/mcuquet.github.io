Businesses, tourism attractions, public transportation hubs and other points
of interest are not isolated but part of a collaborative system. Making such
collaborative network surface is not always an easy task. The existence of
data-rich environments can assist in the reconstruction of collaborative
networks. They shed light into how their members operate and reveal a
potential for value creation via collaborative approaches. Social media data
are an example of a means to accomplish this task. In this paper, we
reconstruct a network of tourist locations using fine-grained data from
Flickr, an online community for photo sharing. We have used a publicly
available set of Flickr data provided by Yahoo! Labs. To analyse the complex
structure of tourism systems, we have reconstructed a network of visited
locations in Europe, resulting in around 180,000 vertices and over 32 million
edges. An analysis of the resulting network properties reveals its complex
structure.
