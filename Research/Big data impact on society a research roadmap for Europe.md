With its rapid growth and increasing adoption, big data is producing a growing
impact in society. Its usage is opening both opportunities such as new
business models and economic gains and risks such as privacy violations and
discrimination. Europe is in need of a comprehensive strategy to optimise the
use of data for a societal benefit and increase the innovation and
competitiveness of its productive activities. In this paper, we contribute to
the definition of this strategy with a research roadmap that considers the
positive and negative externalities associated with big data, maps research
and innovation topics in the areas of data management, processing, analytics,
protection, visualisation, as well as non-technical topics, to the
externalities they can tackle, and provides a time frame to address these
topics.
