We study entanglement distribution in quantum complex networks where nodes are
connected by bipartite entangled states. These networks are characterized by a
complex structure, which dramatically affects how information is transmitted
through them. For pure quantum state links, quantum networks exhibit a
remarkable feature absent in classical networks: it is possible to effectively
rewire the network by performing local operations on the nodes. We propose a
family of such quantum operations that decrease the entanglement percolation
threshold of the network and increase the size of the giant connected
component. We provide analytic results for complex networks with an arbitrary
(uncorrelated) degree distribution. These results are in good agreement with
numerical simulations, which also show enhancement in correlated and
real-world networks. The proposed quantum preprocessing strategies are not
robust in the presence of noise. However, even when the links consist of
(noisy) mixed-state links, one can send quantum information through a
connecting path with a fidelity that decreases with the path length. In this
noisy scenario, complex networks offer a clear advantage over regular
lattices, namely, the fact that two arbitrary nodes can be connected through a
relatively small number of steps, known as the small-world effect. We
calculate the probability that two arbitrary nodes in the network can
successfully communicate with a fidelity above a given threshold. This amounts
to working out the classical problem of percolation with a limited path
length. We find that this probability can be significant even for paths
limited to few connections and that the results for standard (unlimited)
percolation are soon recovered if the path length exceeds by a finite amount
the average path length, which in complex networks generally scales
logarithmically with the size of the network.
