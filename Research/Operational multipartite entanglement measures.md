We introduce two operational entanglement measures that are applicable for
arbitrary multipartite (pure or mixed) states. One of them characterizes the
potentiality of a state to generate other states via local operations assisted
by classical communication and the other characterizes the simplicity of
generating the state at hand. We show how these measures can be generalized to
two classes of entanglement measures. Moreover, we compute the new measures
for pure few-partite systems and use them to characterize the entanglement
contained in a three-qubit state. We identify the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
and W state as the most powerful pure three-qubit states regarding state
manipulation.
