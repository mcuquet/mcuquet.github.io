## Abstract

Locally maximally entangleable states (LMES) are a class of multipartite
quantum states characterized by 2<sup>n-1</sup> real phases, where n is the
number of qubits. Prominent examples of LMES are graph states and stabilizer
states.  They can be prepared by applying general phase gates to a product
state. One can associate any LMES to a weighted hypergraph, identifying each
of these phase gates acting non-trivially on a subset of qubits to a weighted
hyperedge connecting a subset of vertices. In this regard, they can be
understood as a generalization of (weighted) graph states. The hypergraph, or
equivalently the 2<sup>n-1</sup> phases, determine the entanglement.

We investigated the entanglement of LME states, ie their usefulness as a
resource when the parties are separated and their manipulation is restricted
to local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We discuss local
unitary (LU) and stochastic LOCC equivalence of these states. In some cases,
LU equivalence can be reduced to the much simpler case of equivalence under
the action of local Pauli gates, which simplifies the characterization of
LU-equivalent classes. We also present the convertibility of LMESs under local
operations and classical communication (LOCC) to characterize the set of
states that can be deterministically obtained from them.
