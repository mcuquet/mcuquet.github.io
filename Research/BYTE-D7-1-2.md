BYTE has culminated in the launch of the BYTE Big Data Community (BBDC), a
sustainable, cross-disciplinary platform set to implement the roadmap
identified throughout the project, and to assist the European stakeholders in
identifying and meeting the big data challenges, to finally achieve the
scenario envisioned by BYTE for 2020.

Although several organisations, some supported by the EC, like the Big Data
Value Association (BDVA), are gathering stakeholders together to capture big
data innovations, BYTE is quite unique in examining the economic, legal,
social, ethical and political externalities associated with the collection,
linking and sharing of big data. In fact, BYTE is focused on alleviating
societal concerns and including civil society organisations in the community,
as well as policy-makers.

This document outlines a strategy and a value proposition for the BBDC,
considering that it will channel its contribution mainly through the BDVA.
This option is enabled by the collaboration established between BYTE and the
BDVA steering committee during the course of the project.

This document also outlines: an impact strategy, leveraging BYTE stakeholder
engagement and dissemination activities to incentivise active participation in
the BBDC; a charter, including governance structure, membership criteria and
activity types, aligned with those of the BDVA. It also describes the
development plan of the BBDC, divided in three phases and appropriate
milestones, during the course of the project and beyond.
