This paper presents the risks and opportunities of big data and the potential
social benefits it can bring. The research is based on an analysis of the
societal impacts observed in a set of six case studies across different
European sectors. These impacts are divided into economic, social and ethical,
legal and political impacts, and affect areas such as improved efficiency,
innovation and decision making, changing business models, dependency on public
funding, participation, equality, discrimination and trust, data protection
and intellectual property rights, private and public tensions and losing
control to actors abroad. A special focus is given to the risks and
opportunities coming from the legal framework and how to counter the negative
impacts of big data. Recommendations are presented for four specific legal
frameworks: copyright and database protection, protection of trade secrets,
privacy and data protection and anti-discrimination. In addition, the
potential social benefits of big data are exemplified in six domains: improved
decision making and event detection; data-driven innovations and new business
models; direct social, environmental and other citizen benefits; citizen
participation, transparency and public trust; privacy-aware data practices;
and big data for identifying discrimination. Several best practices are
suggested to capture these benefits.
