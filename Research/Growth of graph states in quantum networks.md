We propose a scheme to distribute graph states over quantum networks in the
presence of noise in the channels and in the operations. The protocol can be
implemented efficiently for large graph sates of arbitrary (complex) topology.
We benchmark our scheme with two protocols where each connected component is
prepared in a node belonging to the component and subsequently distributed via
quantum repeaters to the remaining connected nodes. We show that the fidelity
of the generated graphs can be written as the partition function of a
classical Ising-type Hamiltonian. We give exact expressions of the fidelity of
the linear cluster and results for its decay rate in random graphs with
arbitrary (uncorrelated) degree distributions.
