Entanglement is the resource to overcome the natural limitations of spatially
separated parties restricted to local operations assisted by classical
communication (LOCC). Recently, two new classes of operational entanglement
measures, the source and the accessible entanglement, for arbitrary
multipartite states have been introduced. Whereas the source entanglement
measures from how many states the state of interest can be obtained via LOCC,
the accessible entanglement measures how many states can be reached via LOCC
from the state at hand. We consider here pure bipartite as well as
multipartite states and derive explicit formulas for the source entanglement.
Moreover, we obtain explicit formulas for a whole class of source entanglement
measures that characterize the simplicity of generating a given bipartite pure
state via LOCC. Furthermore, we show how the accessible entanglement can be
computed numerically. For generic four-qubit states we first derive the
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of LOCC transformations
among these states and then derive explicit formulas for their accessible and
source entanglement.
