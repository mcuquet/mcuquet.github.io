Lorenzo Bigagli, **Martí Cuquet**, Anna Fensel, Jarl Magnusson.  
[D7.2.1 BYTE Project](http://byte-project.eu/research), 31 January 2017.  

BYTE has culminated in the launch of the BYTE Big Data Community (BBDC), a
sustainable, cross-disciplinary platform that will implement the roadmap
identified within the project, and will assist the European stakeholders in
identifying and meeting the big data challenges, to finally achieve the
scenario envisioned by BYTE for 2020.

Continued engagement and dialogue with stakeholders are key success factors
for the implementation of a European research and policy roadmap for big data
and to achieve the BYTE vision. Hence, the BBDC will be sustainable also after
the close of the BYTE project, at least until 2020.
  
This document identifies possible measures to sustain the BBDC for its
anticipated time of operation, including a letter of intent by committed
members (among which, the partners of the BYTE consortium), a funding plan and
a list of possible funding opportunities. It also outlines measures to sustain
the possible future evolution of the BBDC, to ensure its continued efficiency
and effectiveness.
