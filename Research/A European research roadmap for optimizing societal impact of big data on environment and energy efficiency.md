We present a roadmap to guide European research efforts towards a socially
responsible big data economy that maximizes the positive impact of big data in
environment and energy efficiency. The goal of the roadmap is to allow
stakeholders and the big data community to identify and meet big data
challenges, and to proceed with a shared understanding of the societal impact,
positive and negative externalities, and concrete problems worth
investigating. It builds upon a case study focused on the impact of big data
practices in the context of Earth Observation that reveals both positive and
negative effects in the areas of economy, society and ethics, legal frameworks
and political issues. The roadmap identifies European technical and
non-technical priorities in research and innovation to be addressed in the
upcoming five years in order to deliver societal impact, develop skills and
contribute to standardization.
