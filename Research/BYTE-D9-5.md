[D9.5 BYTE Project](http://byte-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/D9.5-Big-data-for-good-final.pdf), 30 September 2016.

The following document contains a summary of the externalities found in the
BYTE case studies, the risks and opportunities of big data from a legal
perspective, and the potential social benefits it can bring. The BYTE project
is a multi-disciplinary study of the societal impacts of big data in seven
European sectors aimed to define a roadmap and create a community that address
and optimise these impacts. The goal of this Big data for good document is to
present a concise summary of the BYTE results to support the community
building process.

The BYTE project has observed positive and negative externalities in its case
studies:

**Crisis informatics** examines the use of social media data to assist in
humanitarian relief efforts during crisis situations.

**Culture** examines a pan-European cultural heritage organisation that acts as an
aggregator of medata of European cultural heritage organisations.

**Energy** focuses on the impact of big data in exploration and production of oil
and gas in the Norwegian Continental Shelf.

**Environment**, conducted in the context of an earth observation data portal
(EarthObvs), a global-scale initiative for better understanding and
controlling the environment, to benefit society through better-informed
decision-making.

**Healthcare** focuses on the use of genetic data as it is utilised by a public
health data driven research organisation.

**Smart city** focuses on the creation of value from potentially massive amounts
of urban data that emerges through the digitalised interaction of a city’s
users, i.e. of citizens and businesses, with the urban infrastructure.

**Transport** focuses on the increased availability and use of data in the
maritime industry.

The externalities are divided into economic, social and ethical, legal and
political externalities, and affect areas such as improved efficiency,
innovation and decision making, changing business models, dependency on public
funding, participation, equality, discrimination and trust, data protection
and intellectual property rights, private and public tensions and losing
control to actors abroad.

A special focus is given to the risks and opportunities coming from the legal
framework and how to counter the negative impacts of big data, and also to the
potential social benefits when data is used responsibly.

Big data practices affect the interactions between actors, and legal
frameworks need to adapt to avoid negative externalities. To this aim,
objectives of legal frameworks have to be clarified and evaluated to see if
the framework is still effective, individual mechanisms have to be substituted
by collective or aggregate ones, and as much as possible of the decision-
making has to be moved to the design phase. Recommendations in these
directions are presented for four specific legal frameworks: copyright and
database protection, protection of trade secrets, privacy and data protection
and anti-discrimination.

The potential social benefit is exemplified in six different domains: improved
decision making and event detection, including efficient resource allocation;
data-driven innovations, including new business models; direct social,
environmental and other citizen benefits; citizen participation, transparency
and public trust; privacy-aware data practices; and big data for identifying
discrimination.

To conclude and capture these benefits, several best practices are suggested.
These involve public investments and funding programs to solve the scarcity of
European big data infrastructures, promote research and innovation in big
data, open more government data and persuade big private actors to release
some of their data as well, so data partnerships can be built around them,
promoting of new data sources, business models and interoperability, and
education policies to provide both highly skilled data scientists and
engineers and generally data-savvy professionals and citizens.
