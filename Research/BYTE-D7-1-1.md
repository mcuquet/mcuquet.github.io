BYTE will culminate in the launch of the BYTE Big Data Community (BBDC), a
sustainable, cross-disciplinary platform that will implement the roadmap
identified throughout the project, and will assist the European stakeholders
in identifying and meeting the big data challenges, to finally achieve the
scenario envisioned by BYTE for 2020.

Although several organisations, some supported by the EC, like the Big Data
Value Association (BDVA), are gathering stakeholders together to capture big
data innovations, BYTE is quite unique in examining the economic, legal,
social, ethical and political externalities associated with the collection,
linking and sharing of big data. In fact, BYTE is focused on alleviating
societal concerns and including civil society organisations in the community,
as well as policy- makers.

This document outlines an interim strategy and a value proposition for the
BBDC, taking as a first-choice working hypothesis that it will channel its
contribution through the BDVA. In light of this preferred initial option, BYTE
has already begun a process of exploring such collaboration with the BDVA
steering committee.

This document also outlines: an interim impact strategy, leveraging BYTE
stakeholder engagement and dissemination activities to incentivise active
participation in the BBDC; a tentative plan for the development of the BBDC,
divided in three phases, with appropriate milestones until the end of the
project; a tentative charter, including governance structure, membership
criteria and activity types, aligned with those of the BDVA.

This interim strategy and charter will be finalised near the end of the
project.
